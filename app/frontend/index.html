                    <p>
                        Carmichael numbers are composite numbers that satisfy a congruence 
                        relation typically associated with prime numbers in modular 
                        arithmetic. Fermat's Little Theorem states that if <span class="math">p</span> is prime, 
                        then for any integer <span class="math">a</span>, the number <span class="math">a<sup>p</sup> − a</span> is an integer multiple of 
                        <span class="math">p</span>. Carmichael numbers are composite numbers that share this property, 
                        passing a Fermat primality test to every base relatively prime to 
                        the number despite not being prime. The first seven Carmichael 
                        numbers were discovered by Czech mathematician 
                        Václav Šimerka in 1885, with the smallest being 561 
                        (equal to 3 × 11 × 17). These numbers are relatively rare: 
                        there are 20,138,200 Carmichael numbers between 1 and 10<sup>21</sup>, 
                        yet they are infinite in number, as proven by Alford, Granville, 
                        and Pomerance in 1994.

            <h3>Applications of Carmichael Numbers</h3>
            <p>
                Carmichael numbers are significant in cryptography and primality testing, 
                where they reveal limitations of certain verification methods. The fact that 
                Carmichael numbers constitute rare instances where the strict converse of 
                Fermat's Little Theorem does not hold precludes using that theorem as an 
                absolute test of primality. This makes tests based solely on Fermat's Little 
                Theorem less effective than strong probable prime tests such as the Baillie-PSW 
                primality test and the Miller-Rabin primality test, which are crucial for 
                cryptographic systems like RSA encryption. Understanding Carmichael numbers has 
                led to the development of more sophisticated primality testing algorithms that 
                avoid being fooled by these pseudoprimes, making them essential to modern 
                computational number theory and the security of cryptographic protocols.
